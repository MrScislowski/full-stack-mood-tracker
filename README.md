## Summary

## Goals

## To-do

- get a backend running
- get build script so that we're serving dist from the backend
- figure out branching... let's never edit the main branch directly. Ask GPT what to name branches, and whether to delete them right after PR merges etc
- start tracking with json-server
- set up unit tests (for json server etc)
- set up e2e tests using playwright
- get github actions automated with tests etc
- deploy to digital ocean
- get tailwindcss and/or chakra on there
