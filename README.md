# Mood Tracker

## Summary

This web app was created to experiment with the CI/CD resources described in [part 11](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part11). I decided to experiment with using the build tools to try to deploy to a Digital Ocean droplet. It's hosted at scislowski.dev.

## This branch

### Other tasks

- Reinstate husky while [understanding it more](https://typicode.github.io/husky/get-started.html)
- the unit tests are usually passing, but the extensive tests are failing because the json-server isn't starting, because there's already a service started on that port... (this is on Windows; maybe ignore this?)
