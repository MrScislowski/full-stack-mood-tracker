# Mood Tracker

## Summary

## Goals

## To-do

- fix the prettier/prettier inconsistency with my vscode extension where auto commas are added after an array entry... OR, run pnpm run lint --fix after every format on save. Maybe use [this](https://khalilstemmler.com/blogs/tooling/prettier/) as a guide
- set up error handling
- set up simple e2e tests with playwright
- add error tracking, maybe with middleware
- get github actions automated with tests etc
- deploy to digital ocean
- get tailwindcss and/or chakra on there
